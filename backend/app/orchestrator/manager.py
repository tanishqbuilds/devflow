"""Orchestration manager.

Responsibilities:
* Enqueue analysis jobs into the in-memory job queue.
* Run background worker(s) that pop jobs and drive the workflow.
* Stream events directly from ai-services over HTTP, persist every event to
  PostgreSQL / Supabase, buffer events in the in-memory event bus, and broadcast
  them to connected WebSockets.
